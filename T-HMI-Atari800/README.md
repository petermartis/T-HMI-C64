# T-HMI-Atari800

Atari 800 XL emulator for the Lilygo T-HMI (ESP32-S3) board.

## Overview

T-HMI-Atari800 is an Atari 800 XL computer emulator designed to run on ESP32-S3 based development boards with LCD displays. It emulates the complete Atari 8-bit hardware including:

- **6502 CPU** - Full instruction set including undocumented opcodes
- **ANTIC** - Display list processor with all 14 graphics modes
- **GTIA** - Graphics/color controller with player/missile graphics
- **POKEY** - 4-channel audio and keyboard/I/O controller
- **PIA** - Parallel I/O adapter for joystick input

## Supported Hardware

| Board | Display | Audio | SD Card |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| Lilygo T-HMI | 320x240 TFT | No | Yes |
| Lilygo T-Display S3 | 536x240 AMOLED | No | No |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-LCD-2.8 | 320x240 TFT | Yes (I2S) | Yes |

## Features

- 64KB RAM (Atari 800 XL configuration)
- PAL timing (50Hz display, 312 scanlines)
- Hardware-accelerated display output
- 4-channel POKEY audio synthesis
- Web-based keyboard input over WiFi
- BLE keyboard support (with companion Android app)
- Joystick support via analog GPIO
- SD card support for loading .XEX/.ATR files

## Building

### Prerequisites

1. Install Arduino CLI:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

2. Install ESP32 Arduino core:
```bash
make install-core
```

### Compile

```bash
# For Lilygo T-HMI with web keyboard
make BOARD=T_HMI KEYBOARD=WEB_KEYBOARD

# For Waveshare with BLE keyboard
make BOARD=WAVESHARE KEYBOARD=BLE_KEYBOARD
```

### Upload

```bash
make upload PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
```

## ROM Files

The emulator includes a minimal OS ROM for testing. For full compatibility with Atari software, you should use proper ROM files:

### Recommended: Altirra OS/BASIC (Free)

The Altirra OS and BASIC are high-quality replacements that are freely redistributable with emulators. Download from:
- https://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html

### Original ROMs

Alternatively, you can use original Atari ROMs:
- **OS ROM**: atarixl.rom (16KB, Rev 2 recommended)
- **BASIC ROM**: atbasic.rom (8KB, Rev C recommended)

Place ROM files in the `src/roms/` directory and rebuild.

## Input Methods

### Web Keyboard (Default)

1. On first boot, the device starts as a WiFi access point
2. Connect to the "Atari800-xxxx" network
3. Navigate to http://192.168.4.1
4. Enter your home WiFi credentials
5. On subsequent boots, access the keyboard at the device's IP address

### BLE Keyboard

1. Install the companion Android app from the `android/` directory
2. Enable Bluetooth on your phone
3. Pair with the device
4. Use the on-screen keyboard in the app

### Physical Joystick

Connect an analog joystick shield:
- X-axis: GPIO15 (ADC)
- Y-axis: GPIO16 (ADC)
- Fire button: GPIO18
- Secondary button: GPIO17

## Console Keys

The Atari console keys are mapped to:
- **START**: Joystick fire + up
- **SELECT**: Joystick fire + down
- **OPTION**: Joystick fire + left
- **RESET**: Joystick fire + right (long press)
